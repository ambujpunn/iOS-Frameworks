// Note: Keeping inside Common module so that Stores can be created easily from anywhere. This would allow this main file for Store declaration to sit independently
// of different Store modules. All the Store modules will be stored inside a "Stores" group
// Note: Making all functions mutating because we want Stores to be structs so they can be easily passed around rather than references. Change in future if need be
